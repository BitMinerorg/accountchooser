      <h3>Website operators</h3>
      <p>By deploying an account chooser on your website you should expect to increase sign up and log in rates on your websites, as well as reduce costs from hijacked accounts and users who have trouble logging into their account.</p>
      <p>There are a few websites where you can experiment with an account chooser:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google now provides the option to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gitooldocs/experiment---account-chooser">opt-in to using an account chooser</a> instead of Google’s traditional email/password based login box</li>
        <li>A <a href="http://openidsamplestore.com/basic/">sample e-commerce site</a> is also available that uses an account chooser</li>
        <li>There is also <a href="https://account-chooser.appspot.com/">a test site</a> which lets you manually reconfigure your account after you login</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can watch an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efd24dL6uS0">8 minute video</a> of the account chooser experience on two websites, including on Google.  There is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2VwTj5Gigc">4 minute video</a> on some more advanced features of identity providers.</p>
      <p>There are multiple ways to deploy an account chooser.  The quickest option is generally to use a SaaS vendor who provides an account chooser as well as integration with popular identity providers.  Current SaaS vendors in this category include the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/identitytoolkit/">Google Identity Toolkit</a> and <a href="http://www.janrain.com/products/login-helper">Janrain Login Helper</a>.</p>
      <p>Another option is to use a JavaScript widget that implements an account chooser, but then operate your own server side logic to integrate with identity providers.  It is possible to use the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/identitytoolkit/">Google Identity Toolkit</a> in this mode, and other vendors may provide similar widgets in the future.</p>
      <p>The last option is to build your own account chooser.  <a href="ux.html">Please refer to the “account chooser design” pages</a> for detailed descriptions of the user experience and user interface including HTML and CSS that you can use.</p>
