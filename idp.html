			<h3>Identity Providers</h3>
			<p>Any email provider and/or website can become an identity provider.  However most websites will only trust identity providers with a strong reputation for reliability, security, and usability.  Identity providers who feel they offer a high quality service can choose to be certified to increase the number of relying parties wo will trust them.<br /><br />Some email providers or websites may not want to operate their identity provider themselves.  In that case there are Software-as-as-Service offerings that can run an identity provider on behalf of the websites.  Vendors include VMWare, Ping Identity, Janrain, Google Apps, Microsoft Azure, etc.  The SaaS vendors generally only need to be certified once, and then any of their customers can become a trusted source of identity.<br /><br />Every email provider should strongly consider becoming an identity provider.  Otherwise those email users will be susceptible to the security threats of password reuse.  This includes not just consumer email providers, but also businesses and schools.<br /><br />Websites that expose APIs to 3rd party websites, such as social networks or other platform offerings, should also consider becoming an identity provider.  However in many cases these website do not need to become certified because their 3rd party partners generally have already choosen to integrate with them based on the reptuation of their APIs, and not just their login system.</p>
